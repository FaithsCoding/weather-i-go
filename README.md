##Project Description
For our first project we have created an events app. 

"Weather I Go" is going to allow users to search for a city, type of event, genres, date and time of event, price range, And find events that fit within their given parameters using data from the ticketmaster API, then using weather API, so the user can also see what the weather is like on that day.

## User Story
```
AS an event go-er i would like a webpage where i can find tickets to events and the weather conditions,
I WANT a webpage which allows me to find events and shows me how the weather will be,
SO THAT I can find events I am likely to enjoy, and see what the weather contitions shall be.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN an events app has been created
AND uses 2 different API's
WHEN I search for a city, date & time 
THEN events within that area appear alongside the local weather 
WHEN I click the 'calander' icon 
THEN I am presented with a calendar which takes my input and has the options to validate, choose 'today', clear or cancel. 
WHEN the events appear alongside the weather
THEN the time and date, title and other information provided by the API is also displayed
THEN I can navigate using next & previous buttons


GIVEN a CSS framewrok other than Bootstrap is used
WHEN I view the HTML
THEN my tutor will see in-line styling from BULMA


Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).

* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

* Be responsive.

* Have a polished UI.

* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

<p><a href="[https://openweathermap.org/](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/discover?utm_source=Docs_GS_Button&ref=https:%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fmaps%2F&_gl=1*90zukj*_ga*NzM4MDk5NTkuMTY3ODk4OTA5Ng..*_ga_NRWSTWS78N*MTY3ODk4OTA5Ni4xLjAuMTY3ODk4OTEwNC4wLjAuMA..&pli=1)">GoogleMaps</a></p>
```

## Usage
```
Weather I Go allows users to search for a town or city, or use their 'current location' to search for their local events & weather. 
When the user has completed their input then this will show them cards with the event details, title, date, time & weather.
Additionally, when the search button has been clicked their current location will be displayed using Goggle Maps.

##Overall
```
We have made a good app in a short time considering it was our first time collaborating. This project has a lot of scalability therefore given more time I believe this could be an app that would be useful to a wide variety of people.
