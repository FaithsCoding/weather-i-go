# weather-i-go
An events app being created for our project 1.

"Weather I Go" is going to allow users to search for a city, type of event, genres, date and time of event, price range. And find events that fit within their given parameters using ticketmasters API, then using weather API, we seee what the weather is like on that day.

## User Story

I WANT a webpage which allows me to find events and shows me how the weather will be,
SO THAT I can find events I am likely to enjoy, and see what the weather contitions shall be.
